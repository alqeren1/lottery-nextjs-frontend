# Lottery Next.js Frontend

This repository contains a Next.js frontend for the Lottery smart contract project. It serves as a practice project to learn how to build modern web interfaces with Next.js and interact with blockchain smart contracts.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a Next.js web application that connects to the Lottery smart contract. It provides users with an interface to view lottery details, participate by funding the lottery, and check the lottery results. The project is designed as a learning exercise for integrating smart contract interactions into a Next.js website.

## Features

- **Next.js Framework:** Utilizes Next.js for server-side rendering and improved performance.
- **Blockchain Integration:** Connects to the Lottery smart contract to fetch data and perform transactions.
- **User Interface:** Simple and responsive UI for interacting with the lottery.
- **Smart Contract Interaction:** Enables functionalities such as funding the lottery and checking the current state of the contract.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Make sure you have Node.js installed.
- **Yarn or npm:** Package manager to install dependencies.
- **MetaMask:** Browser extension for connecting to the Ethereum network.
